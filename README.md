# AI Engineering

This repository tracks my complete journey of becoming an AI engineer.  
It includes all the topics I study, from Python and machine learning to large language models and deployment.

## Structure

- ðŸ“Š Data Science & ML (Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- ðŸ§  Deep Learning (CNN, RNN, PyTorch)
- ðŸ¤– Large Language Models (BERT, GPT, LLaMA)
- ðŸš€ AI Deployment (FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes)
- ðŸ§ª Final Projects

## Learning Pace

Although the original curriculum spans 26 weeks, I plan to compress it into 3 months by intensive learning and self-paced progress.

## Goal

To develop and document full-stack AI capabilities and build public-facing projects to demonstrate my skills.

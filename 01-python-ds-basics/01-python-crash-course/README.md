# Python Crash Course (Section 01 of AI Curriculum)

## üîç Overview

This section covers the core Python syntax in a fast-track, hands-on format using Jupyter Notebooks.  
Each concept is immediately followed by testable examples, allowing for real-time execution and experimentation.

The exercises and reference notebooks are part of the official course content, while the main notebook was written and completed by me during lecture.

## üìÇ File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01-my python crash course.ipynb` | Self-written practice notebook during the lecture |
| `02-master reference.ipynb` | Instructor-provided reference code |
| `03-exercises.ipynb` | Provided exercises ‚Äì all solved by me |
| `04-exercise solutions.ipynb` | Instructor-provided solution notebook for comparison |

## üß† What I Learned / Revisited

Although I had previously completed a portion of the ‚Äú100 Days of Python Bootcamp,‚Äù this section served as a helpful and effective review.

- Revisited Python basics: variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, conditionals, and loops
- Refreshed my understanding of:
  - `format()` for structured string formatting
  - `split()` for parsing string data
  - `lambda` functions for simple functional programming
- Reinforced fluency in using **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding

Overall, this was a great chance to reinforce syntax accuracy and restore fluency through real-time code execution.

## ‚úÖ Highlights

- Everything was tested within the notebook environment.
- All exercises were completed from scratch.
- Markdown cells were used to summarize and explain where necessary.

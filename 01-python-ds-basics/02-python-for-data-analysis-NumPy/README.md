# NumPy Basics (Section 02)

## üîç Overview

In this section, I studied the NumPy module, which is fundamental in Data Science and machine learning workflows.  
NumPy provides efficient matrix creation, manipulation, and computation capabilities through a wide range of built-in methods.

## üìÇ File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01-my numpy arrays.ipynb` | My own notebook for array creation and basic syntax |
| `01-ref numpy arrays.ipynb` | Instructor's reference code |
| `02-my numpy indexing.ipynb` | My practice notebook for indexing and slicing |
| `02-ref numpy indexing.ipynb` | Instructor's reference on indexing |
| `03-my numpy operations.ipynb` | My practice on array operations |
| `03-ref numpy operations.ipynb` | Instructor's reference for array operations |
| `04-numpy exercises.ipynb` | Exercise notebook completed by me |
| `05-numpy exercises solutions.ipynb` | Provided solutions for comparison |

## üìÇ Covered Topics

- Importing NumPy with alias: `import numpy as np`
- Creating arrays with:
  - `np.array()`
  - `np.arange()`
  - `np.random` methods for generating random matrices
- Matrix operations using arithmetic operators (`+`, `*`, etc.)
- Indexing and slicing using standard Python syntax (e.g., `arr[1:, :2]`)
- Element-wise operations between arrays
- Understanding the difference between `int32` and `int64` data types (`dtype`)

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- NumPy arrays are much more powerful and flexible than standard Python lists for numerical computing.
- The module allows for both simple and complex operations to be performed with very concise syntax.
- Random number generation within NumPy (`np.random.rand`, `np.random.randint`) is a valuable tool for simulations or data augmentation.
- Learning about different `dtype` options such as `int32` and `int64` helped me understand how data storage and memory usage can differ.

## üí¨ Personal Reflection

Using NumPy made me realize how much more efficient and elegant array operations can be.  
The ability to slice and compute across entire arrays with a single line of code is incredibly useful, and I can already see how this will be essential for future projects in AI and data analysis.
